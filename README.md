I have used chat GPT to educate my self on the graphs Tsetlin machine to understand more of the code it self. 

The dataset i Hex:game.py are created from the code published on canvas for the hex game that was in C.
I have converted the code into python where i have had some help from chat GPT.
But the functions that i used to get the state of the moves at end, two moves before end and five moved before end are my own work. 

Grap_T_init_.py has been made whit help from the github https://github.com/cair/TsetlinMachine

I have had help from chat GPT to find i way to plot the graphs whit the nodes and egdes in visualize.py
